# Car aircond controller knob aid with fuzzy logic

## Problem Statement

Most, if not all, of the car aircond control knobs are manual, and the auto mode is seldom used because of its lack of precision and hence the inability to provide any comfort. Worse still, a lot of car models' so-called auto mode occationally turns on/off the fans based on the cabin temperature detected. Moreover, the fan speed knob is divided into around 3-4 or even 5 discrete steps. For instance, when driving, fan speed 3 may be too strong, but fan speed 2 is too weak. The act of often adjusting the aircond causes the driver's attention to be diverted, and consequently jeopardises the driver's safety. There's no way to get it in between! On the other hand, the auto mode doesn't even touch the temperature adjust knob. We need an automation system that adjusts the two knobs - temperature and fan speed, based on real-time cabin temperature, and also in a continuous manner for the sake of accuracy and precision which gives comfort, convenience and ultimately, road safety in return.
